Sahyog: Policy Doc Retriever (with Caching)
This is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) API that processes policy documents and answers questions with high accuracy.

Version: 4.2.0

How it Works
On-the-fly Processing: The API receives a document URL and a list of questions.
Caching: It calculates a SHA-256 hash of the document's content. If this hash has been seen before, it retrieves a pre-built query engine from an in-memory cache.
Indexing: If it's a new document, it's processed using BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 for embeddings and indexed into a FAISS vector store. The resulting query engine is then cached.
Querying: It uses the query engine and a gpt-4o model with a strict prompt to answer the user's questions based only on the provided document.
